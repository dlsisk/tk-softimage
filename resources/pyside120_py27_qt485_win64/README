This version of PySide was compiled from source against the built-in version
of Python 2.7 for Softimage 2014 on Windows using the following versions:

Qt 4.8.5
PySide 1.2.0
Shiboken 1.2.0
Visual Studio 2010

See http://qt-project.org/ for further details.

If you choose to use an external version of Python then you should ensure
that a compatible version of PySide is also installed with it.
