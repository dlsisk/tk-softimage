Build instructions for Pyside, QT and Python - on Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------

This version of pyside was built with python 2.5.2 (64 bit) and QT 4.8.5 specifically for 
Softimage 2013.  Everything is built with gcc 4.1.1

These instructions assume a clean centos 6 linux build.
